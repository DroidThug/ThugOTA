**Warning : Work in progress. It works, but has lots of rough edges right now.**

BorkedDelta is a delta update method for XOSP. Instead of downloading full ROM zips, it uses deltas to reduce the download size.
BorkedDelta uses xdelta3 (http://xdelta.org) between the previous and current release. Quote from github.com/omnirom/android_packages_apps_OpenDelta/blob/android-6.0/README.md   :
**"Usually, OTA ZIP files created by Android builds are compressed.Diffs between compressed OTA ZIPs are not ideal - they are significantly larger than the diff between two uncompressed OTA ZIPs would be. So before we create the diff we decompress the contents of the OTA ZIPs."** BorkedDelta uses Chainfire's and OmniROM's zipadjust to decompress the zips.

Delta specifications
---------------------------------

The delta is generated by running xdelta3 on the decompressed (or compressed, depending on convenience) zip of the newest, but as yet unreleased ROM, using the decompressed zip of the newest released ROM. The resultant delta is named "diff". All decompressions are done using Chainfire's zipadjust.
After that, certain information about the base ROM, the target ROM, and the generated delta is written as JSON in a file called "deltaconfig". A sample deltaconfig is at the end of this file.
The diff and deltaconfig files are then put into a zip archive without compression, and uploaded to a server. The user downloads it, gives the base ROM and the delta zip to BorkedDelta, and gets the updated ROM.
TO-DO : Automatically fetch the delta and apply it to the correct ROM.

Sample deltaconfig
-------------------------------

{
"source":"<base_rom_name>.zip",
"target":"<target_rom_name>.zip",
"targetMd5":"<target_rom_md5>",
"sourceMd5":"<base_rom_md5>",
"deltaMd5":"<md5_of_the_diff_file>",
"targetSize":<target_rom_size>
}
